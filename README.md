# git-refresh-checkout

Welcome to the git-fresh-checkout GitHub repository!

git-fresh-checkout is a VS Code Extension designed to help streamline your workflow when switching between Git branches. When triggered, it automatically closes any open tabs in the editor, so you can start fresh when you open a new branch.

This extension is especially helpful if you need to jump between branches frequently, or are working on projects with large file structures and many tabs open. Now you can switch branches with ease, without having to worry about manually closing tabs each time.

Thanks for checking out git-fresh-checkout! We hope you find it as useful as we do.
